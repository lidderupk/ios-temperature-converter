# Temperature Converter for your city !

Temperature converter is a simple app for ios that converts Celcius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.
It is built in ObjectiveC using MVC paradigm and uses XCTest framework for [unit tests](https://github.com/8indaas/ios-temperature-converter/tree/master/TemperatureConverterTests).

The Temperature converter was built as part of the [Ios CodePath iOS Mobile Bootcamp](http://thecodepath.com/iosbootcamp). This simple converter takes as input the unit the user wants to convert to and the value. The user can then tap anyhwere on the screen to see the results or use the Done button on the top right corner of the screen.<br/>

In addition to manually entering the temperature, the user can use the "Use current location" button to pre fill the input box with the current temperature for their city. The app gets the temperature in Celcius or Fahrenheit based on the "Conver From:" choice.
